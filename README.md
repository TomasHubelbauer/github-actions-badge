# GitHub Actions Badge

Use this MarkDown snippet to add a GitHub Actions status badge to your repo's readme:

```markdown
![](https://github.com/tomashubelbauer/${repo}/workflows/${name}/badge.svg)
```

```markdown
![](https://github.com/tomashubelbauer/${repo}/workflows/.github/workflows/${name.yml}/badge.svg)
```

You can use GitHub to generate the badge for you. Go to your latest workflow run, click on the
triple-dot menu and select *Create status badge*.
